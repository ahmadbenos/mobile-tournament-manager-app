## App details
App built using react-native(no expo).
Football tournament manager allows users to manage their football league tournaments in a well-organized way with some cool in-app features such as daily voting on real-life football matches.

code details:
 - AWS netlify cloud functions were used in the backend part(daily vote)
 - expo wasn't used therefore i wasn't able to view it on an ios simulator(i have a windows machine). **So,** the app isn't optimized for ios devices.
 - Users' votes are stored on mongoDB in the cloud.
 -  tournament details are stored in the device's local storage(async storage)
 - Didn't work so much on responsiveness but it's fairly compatible to tablets as well.

Features:
 - Clear and simple UI
 - up to 32 teams
 - option to randomize fixtures
 - detailed statistics
 - edit top scorers, top assisters, and most clean sheets
 - view most conceded team and most scored team
 - Nice looking league standings
 - **daily voting on real-life football matches**
 - View how other people are voting in the daily vote
